<p>I'm going to leave the real 2014 retrospective work to the pros. There's too much to cover.  To adequately
memorialize 2014 would be to cover a huge field of topics, from developments in science and technology to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, and everything in between.  2014 was a big year for the world.  And, for millions of people
stemming from a multitude of causes, 2014 has been an unforgettable year of extremes; both extremely good, and
extremely bad.  For many others, 2014 has been without extremes, and will become just another collection of abstract
memories.</p>

<p> I'm thankful that in 2014 my wife and I welcomed our first child, my sister got married, and that my family
and friends were healthy.  To my friends and colleagues who had great years, I hope the party continues into 2015.
To those whose years were about average, I hope 2015 offers a little more excitement, but at least no less consistency.
To my friends and colleagues who would just prefer to forget 2014, I hope your 2015 is bright enough to let you do
that.  </p>

<p> Happy New Year!  </p>
