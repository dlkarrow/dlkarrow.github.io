title: My First Post/HFT
---
<p>This is my first ever blog post.  I feel behind the times! </p>

<p>Hopefully I'll be able to update this blog regularly, though perhaps not frequently.  My goal is to blog about interesting things
going on in financial technology, capital markets, private investing, and trading.  I'll also probably discuss regulatory issues
in this space, because you can't really talk about markets without talking about regulation.   </p>

<p>On that note, I was pleased to see that SIFMA came out with guidelines yesterday relating to certain high frequency trading practices.
  Formally, these are called "recommendations on equity market structure for enhancing fairness, stability and transparency in the U.S.
  stock market."  Some of these recommendations echo those made by Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin to Congress earlier this month,
  particularly with respect to increasing the transparency for retail investors and with lowering access fees. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to watch the debate over HFT continue to take shape.  On the one hand, there appears to be a significant body
of work that shows that HFT contributes to market liquidity in positive ways (John McPartland, a senior policy advisor at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago, summarizes a lot of this research in his article Recommendations for Equitable Allocation of Trades in High
Frequency Trading Environments).  On the other hand, certain HFT strategies seem like they are not additive to market fairness, and
 may in fact be detrimental to it.  This perspective was certainly the focus of Michael Lewis' Flash Boys.   </p>

<p>I'm concerned with the prospect of additional regulation.  For one thing, industry experts seem to disagree over whether HFT is a net
positive or negative to the stability of the financial markets.  Additionally, even if there was some consensus, "HFT" means a lot of
different things to different people, and they're not all bad.  What's really in question is the legitimacy of certain trading strategies
that are used by HFT firms, but the distinction has to be made between ordinary fast and frequent trading, and those potentially more
nefarious strategies.   </p>

<p>My biggest concern over adding/changing regulation to address these issues is one of capacity. The SEC is already mired in a complex
rule making process stemming from the last tidal wave of financial market reform.  They've spent years trying to codify rules relating
to the Dodd Frank Act, signed into law in 2010. They've missed the rule making deadlines for more than half of the required rules, and
by some estimates, they're only about 50% done finalizing all rules related to DFA.  This may not be their fault; the rules are complex.
And while HFT rules will be far more limited in scope that Dodd Frank rules, it does seem impractical to add to the SEC burden at this
point.  One of the more compelling arguments against increased regulation of HFT is that there just isn't any way to do it efficiently. </p>

<p>The best alternative is for the responsibility to reform the market to fall to the market itself. This type of self-policing often doesn't
work, but in the case of HFT, it may.  If you believe the critics of HFT, its not just the "little guy" being harmed by these trade practices,
 it's very large asset management firms who drive lots of business to Wall Street banks and exchanges.  If these big market participants
 demand changes to the market structure, they can flex their muscle and drive those changes without the help of regulators.
 Hopefully they will.    </p>
