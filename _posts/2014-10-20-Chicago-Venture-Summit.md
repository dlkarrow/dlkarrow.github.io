title: Chicago Venture Summit
---
<p>The inaugural Chicago Venture Summit (http://www.chicagoventuresummit.com/) was held last week.  I signed up for this
 event not sure what to expect and with some reservations, but I'm happy to say that it exceeded my expectations.  </p>

<p>The lunchtime keynote address was by Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber.  Travis talked about his early failures, successes,
 the path to growth with Uber, and gave an interesting overview of some of the things they're testing in other cities that
  might come to Chicago someday.  We also got some insight into how a successful entrepreneur sees the role his company
  could play.  Travis doesn't talk about Uber revolutionizing the taxi industry; he talks about how it could increase the
   efficient use of automobiles on the road, and have a massive impact on employment, pollution,  and urban congestion.
    Whether these things are true or not remains to be seen, but it would be hard to find a better example of an entrepreneur
    chasing a Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal (and so far, successfully) than Travis. </p>

<p>Peter Thiel isn't a household name (at least, not in a normal household).  He's the founder of PayPal and an early
 investor in Facebook, among other things.  I hadn't heard him speak before Chicago Venture Summit, but two rather remarkable
  things happened during his talk. First, he sat in a room full of MBAs and stated (again, really, since its not the first
  time he's slighted the degree) that he's not impressed with most MBA candidates and that he finds they have fairly "little
  conviction" about anything, and that they are too "salesy."  To paraphrase his book, Zero to One, when it comes to technology
   companies, he'll take the t-shirt guy over the suit guy any day.   </p>

<p>The second remarkable thing was that a room full of MBAs sat there, laughing at his jokes and hanging on his every word.
 That's because he's really, really sharp.  There are some guys who started companies that were successful on accident,
 or that made investments because they were in the right place at the right time.  Peter gives the impression of being someone
 for whom every move he's ever made has been calculated, not lucky, and who can actually look at an industry and correctly
 predict where it's going.  Of course, there's been some luck, too, and he hasn't been "perfect" (he talked about skipping
 the B-Round of Facebook at a 10x valuation over his initial investment).  But I doubt there was an investor, entrepreneur,
 technologist, or MBA in the audience who wasn't impressed with him.  </p>

<p>The highlight of the event were the featured companies.  The event featured presentations by 30 Midwest-based early stage
companies doing all sorts of things (Auto insurance claim processing, mobile security, travel, data science, and basic skills
education, to name a few).  These companies were all "success stories" by most start-up standards.  They've raised money,
are servicing a large and diverse group of customers, and most importantly, many of them are generating some pretty serious
revenue.  One of the goals of Chicago Venture Summit was to showcase Midwest success stories to coastal investors. I think
this was a great representation, and hopefully they've cause some heads to turn in the direction of Chicago. </p>
<p>Overall, Chicago Venture Summit was a well planned and well attended event.  Hopefully it becomes an annual event.  </p>
