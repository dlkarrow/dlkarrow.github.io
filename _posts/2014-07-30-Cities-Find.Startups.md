title: How Cities Find Startups
---

<p>A few weeks ago, I was included along with other investors in an article for the Chicago Tribune's Blue Sky Innovation
Section on Chicago-area VC trends.  It got me thinking even more about the relationship between companies, founders, and
investors on the one hand, and the cities in which they operate on the other.  </p>

<p>Historically, geography played much more important role in the economic progress of cities than it does today.  Chicago,
for example, had geographical advantages that fueled its identity and growth. Its location was a hub for fur trading in
the late 18th and early 19th centuries because of its convenient location between the Mississippi and the Mackinac Straits;
it became one of the centers of inland transportation because of its proximity to rivers and the Great Lakes; and as the
railroad center of America, Chicago was the opportune home to stockyards, steel mills, and manufacturing centers.  So,
the fact that Chicago became the third biggest city in America and a nucleus of finance, manufacturing, and culture was
arguably due as much to its physical location as to any deliberate steps city planners and governments took to build its
economic relevancy. </p>

<p>Technological innovations have changed what it takes to build big, economically prosperous cities. Startups and investment
dollars are attracted to cities for reasons beyond their natural landscape and physical properties (though those attributes
may play a role in a location's desirability).  So, why do start-ups flock to certain places?  And, what can cities do to
attract and nurture small companies, and retain big ones? </p>

<p>First, startups "go where the money is," which is why San Francisco/San Jose/Sunnyvale, CA continue to see an outsized
portion of total early stage deals (more than 30% of all US venture capital deals) and invest an outsized amount of money
in them (more that 40% of all committed capital.) <em>CityLab ranking, "Top 20 Locations for Venture Capital" </em>.   Silicon
Valley still serves as the Global Capitol of startups and VC, and reflects the truism in business that success breeds
success. </p>

<p>Second, and not surprisingly, founders go where the target customers are and where they can find talent.  This explains
why San Francisco, San Jose, Boston, New York, and Los Angeles- large cities with multiple universities, educated workforces,
and large populations- are the 5 biggest venture capital investment markets in US.  These cities and their surrounding areas
are also among the wealthiest in the country, which probably contributes to accessibility of angel and seed money.
Almost 2/3rds of venture capital investments are funded out of those cities. <em>Id.</em></p>

<p>Third, founders start their companies in regions where they perceive a competitive advantage favoring their industry.
The greater Boston area, for example, is home to seven of the top ten most active biotech and life science venture capital
firms <em>FierceBiotech.com</em>.  Perhaps not coincidentally, over 30% of National Institute of Health research grants are awarded
in Massachusetts, New York, or Pennsylvania <em>NIH RePORT Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools</em>.  Because of the
concentration of research institutes and universities, the Northeast might be seen by some biotech founders and investors
as an ideal region in which to launch or invest in companies.  </p>

<p>Given that these factors help inform the decisions of founders and investors, what can cities do to facilitate lively,
entrepreneurial environments? </p>

<p>I'm not sure there's much that cities can do about the first point.  Eventually, cities that succeed will see their
success breed more success, but it's an ecosystem, and ecosystems take a long time to grow even when the conditions are
ideal.  The same is true for the second point; universities, populations, and research institutions don't just appear
overnight. </p>

<p>What cities can do, and really what they should do, is to identify industries that are either unique to their area, or
in which they have a competitive advantageous over other cities and regions, and leverage those to attract talented
founders and investment dollars.  A city that has large numbers of companies working on alternative energy technologies,
for example, should be focused on incubators, seed programs, mentorships, and partnerships with start-ups in alternative
energy technologies.  Chicago, for example, is an established global financial center that is home to insurance companies,
exchanges, hedge funds, trading firms, and asset managers.  By investing in projects and plans designed to nurture startups
in fields related to those industries, Chicago could find a competitive edge over other cities, and help its own startups
succeed.   </p>

<p>These sorts of targeted programs shouldnâ€™t necessarily preclude the existence of other, broader-based incentives or support
plans cities can offer young companies and entrepreneurs.  But, they should be seen as a way for cities the differentiate
themselves from the traditional centers of VC and startup activity, and to tilt the playing field in their favor.  Every
founder and investor is used to talking about how they're different from the other guys, and proving their unique value.
The cities where all this happens should be able to do it too.</p>
