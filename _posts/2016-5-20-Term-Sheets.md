title: Avoiding "aw shucks" Terms in an Early Stage Term Sheet
---
<p>Investing in early stage companies can present unique opportunities for individuals, family offices,
foundations, and institutions to buy a stake in high growth industries at relatively low valuations. The
risks posed by these investments are also unique; not only do investors have a greater risk of losing their
 entire investment than they might if they were investing in more mature companies, but the private marketplace
  and illiquid nature of these investments creates a series of other risks.  These risks can't necessarily be
  eliminated, but investors focused on these 4 key elements of their next deal will have better odds of avoiding
  some of the more common risks of private investing.  </p>

<p>(<i><strong>An aside</strong>:  It's easy to invest in a startup and fall prey to the idea that the
details don’t matter if the company is wildly successful, because everyone will make money.
I've heard that line a million times from some smart investors, but it's not true.  The details
 matter.  And, they matter way, way more when the company is successful than when it's not.)</i> </p>

<p><strong>#1: Voting/Consent Rights </strong> </p>

<p>As a source of capital for a new company, investors typically have very few rights to participate in the
management or decision making of the company.  And, this is the way it should be.  As much of a platitude as
it's become, investors are investing in the “people” running the show as much as anything else, particularly

at the early stages.  But there are some decisions that can have such a monumental impact on the health of a
 company or the economics of the investment that investors should negotiate some participation in the decision
 making process.  Investors looking to exercise some control over the company should negotiate for voting rights
 or consent rights over certain material matters.    </p>

<p>Voting rights allow for investors to vote on certain matters, typically outlined in an operating agreement
or set of corporate bylaws.  Like with public companies, they are very often allocated on a "vote-per-share"
basis, which means that larger investors typically have more votes than smaller investors. Some matters that
are often subject to a vote are whether to merge or sell the company, to issue more shares, or to increase the
salary of directors or officers.</p>

<p>Consent rights are a step beyond voting rights.  They are typically given to specific individual investors
or share classes, and represent a de-facto "veto" right over a specified list of actions.  An investor with
consent rights must agree to certain actions before they can be taken, giving the investor virtually absolute
 authority to prevent specific corporate activities.  Often, a large or strategically important investor can get
 consent rights over similar issues as a company might offer voting rights, like modifying the bylaws or operating
  agreement, admitting new members, or selling the company.  But consent rights are not likely to be offered by the
  company on a first negotiation turn, and will generally only be given to large or strategically important investors. </p>

 <p>As the relationship between a company and an investor change over time, voting and consent rights offer another
 important benefit: engagement.  If a company needs the investor to vote/consent on big issues, than the company is
 forced to keep the investor apprised of what's happening with the company, and to generally keep an open path of
 communication. Of course, any healthy investor-management relationship will look like this, and management using
 good judgment will try to keep early investors apprised of things regardless.  But, as companies grow, maintaining
  this communication can get more tedious, and it's more likely to get lost in the shuffle if the investor isn't
  entitled to certain voting rights. </p>


<p><strong>#2: Tag Along rights</strong>   </p>

<p>Investors in privately held companies-particularly minority investors- are often restricted from transferring their
shares, with some limited exceptions for estate planning purposes or similar investor needs.  This can create a significant
source of friction between these minority shareholders, who can't transfer their interests, and managers and majority investors,
who are often not restricted by equivalent clauses.  Tag-Along rights prevent this misalignment by requiring a shareholder
who has found a buyer for his shares to invite the other shareholders to participate in the deal on a pro-rata basis.
 In other words, the minority investor would get to "tag-along" on a deal negotiated by a manager or larger shareholder.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, tag-along rights serve two purposes.  On the one hand, they're fairness mechanisms. If a third-party
 investor wants to take a stake in a company, that investors will most likely approach the company management or other
 large shareholders.  This may be because they're more easily identified than smaller investors, or because it's easier
  to purchase a large block of shares from one party than trying to put together a deal with multiple parties.  Either
  way, larger shareholders and company management will have access to liquidity that smaller investors won't have.
  Tag-along rights ensure that if there's an opportunity for liquidity in the shares, the smaller investors get
   a "look," too.    </p>


<p>At the same time, tag-along rights are an interest-alignment mechanism.  Large investors or managers looking to sell
shares might have insight into the future of the company that makes it less attractive as an investment.  Setting aside
 statutory protections that might require the smaller investors to be given information related to the prospects of the
 company, tag-along rights ensure that if managers or large investors are planning to sell, smaller investors will, at
 the very least, know about the transaction.  </p>

<p>Mechanically, tag-along provisions can be slightly complicated because management, early stage investors, and later
investors may have different share classes, so the tag-along provisions will have to be structured as "cross class"
provisions.  While this may cause for a slightly more bloated subscription agreement or operating agreement, tag-along
 provisions are common enough that most variations of them have been drafted by attorneys practicing in this area, and
  they shouldn't be overlooked just for simplicities sake. </p>

<p><strong>#3 Liquidation rights </strong>  </p>

<p>Liquidation rights can be one of the most important components an investor can negotiate.  When a company sells
itself, it receives money or property ("money").  That money is distributed according to procedures specified in
operating documents, in a certain order. First, it's typically used to pay off debts, and settle up with preferred

stock/note holders.  Any money remaining after that is distributed to investors, in whatever order was agreed upon
amongst the investors and the company.  Generally, when all investors are buying the same share class of interests,
each dollar distributed to the investors will be divided amongst the participants on a pro rata basis.  In the event
 that the company sells itself for significantly more money than was invested or incurred in debt, the order of the
 distributions doesn't really matter, because every investor will get their principal back, plus a return on their
 investment.  But, if the company receives less money than its liabilities and shareholders’ equity combined, the
  order of distributions becomes critical, and could be the difference between an investor getting his principal
  back or not.  The key to this process- and where liquidation rights come into play- is that a company and its
  investors can agree on a distribution schedule (often called a "waterfall") that distributes money in all sorts
 of different ways, including agreeing to give certain investors a preferential return on their capital ahead of
 other investors.   </p>


<p>In practice, a liquidity preference is likely to present itself like this: Company ABC has raised $3m in seed and
early stage funding rounds from wealthy individuals.  Management has decided that it needs to raise about $1m as part
of an "A" round, their first institutional round.  They have meetings with NewCo Ventures, who agrees to put in the
 $1m dollars at some valuation, and they negotiate a board seat, etc. NewCo also asks for a "1x liquidity preference,"
  and management agrees.</p>

<p>This is an important piece of protection for NewCo Ventures, because when Company ABC is sold, the first $1m
available to be distributed to shareholders ("1x") gets distributed back to NewCo before any of the other investors
 have received a dime.  In the absence of debt or other liabilities, this means that if Company ABC were sold for
  only $1,000,000  (vs. the $4m raised) NewCo would get every penny of their principal back, while all the early and
   seed stage investors would take a complete loss.  What NewCo Ventures did in this example was to use a liquidity
   preference to move its whole investment higher up in the distribution waterfall.  Instead of the $1,000,000 sale
   proceeds being distributed pro-rata among the investors (an outcome that would have seen NewCo receive around $250,000,
    in the absence of any other debt, liabilites, or contract provisions) NewCo's liquidity preference put them at
    the front of the line to receive its money back.  If Company ABC had sold itself for $2m, the same applies;
    NewCo's $1m is returned first, and the second million is distributed pro rata. (Note: Generally, NewCo will
    not be able to realize a profit until the other shareholders have recevied their initial investments back, too;
    so, the second million is likely going to be distributed back pro rata to the other shareholders).   </p>

<p>Importantly, the people left worse off by the liquidity preference are the early and seed stage investors who
put in the original $3m.  In a well negotiated and structured deal, these investors would have been given the
opportunity to participate in the new round of capital and to avail themselves of the liquidity preference on
any new money into the deal.  If they don't, than the change in the waterfall places them at a disadvantage to
the new investors when the first distributions are made.  </p>

<p>(<i><strong>An aside</strong>:  What typically happens is that these  early investors waive their participation rights and by
default, consent to the liquidity preference, either because they lack the interest or ability to put more money into
the investment,  or because they discount the possibility of a company sale for less than the invested capital causing
them to misjudge the importance of the preference.  It's equally important to note that NewCo could be in the same
position if Company ABC decides to raise more money; management can negotiate another liquidity preference with the
new investors, and their capital would sit above NewCo's in the distribution waterfall). </i></p>


<p><strong>#4 Board Seat (or Observation Rights)  </strong> </p>

<p>The last item on this list is the simplest, but there are a few points that require consideration.  Investors
putting money into a company should try to negotiate either a voting board seat or an observation right, which allows
 a representative to be present at board meetings, but doesn't entitle them to a vote.  Board rights will help keep
 the investors informed, give them a forum for addressing management, and most importantly, get more valuable over
 time.  </p>

<p>Traditionally, corporate boards have had two broad roles; First, effective boards will provide advice to
management on strategic directions of the company.  Second, they oversee & monitor company performance. In an
early stage company, these duties look significantly different than they do in a late stage, mature company.  For
one thing, early stage companies tend to be simpler, at least from a governance point of view.  Large multinational
 corporations may require a board of directors to have sub-committees advising on matters like human resources,
 ethics & compliance, and environmental policy.  Early stage companies, for the most part, don't have the same
 requirements.  A founder can usually get the advice they need on a range of topics over a coffee or on a call
 with an engaged, helpful investor.  For this reason, being on a "board" for a startup is really more about a
 friendly, mentoring relationship than it is about strict corporate accountability.  Smart founders will listen
 to advice from smart investors, smart investors will respect the opinions of management, and the formalism of
 "the board" becomes an afterthought.  </p>

<p>But, this dynamic will change over time in a successful company and the value of a board seat will generally
increase as the company grows, for two key reasons:  first, when a company takes on new capital in larger
increments from more sophisticated investors or institutions, the new investors can "crowd out" the early
investors; where the early investor found himself in management's inner circle, privy to all sorts of material
 information about the company and its prospects early on, he may find himself with less access to management.
  This isn't necessarily bad; if the interests of the later investors are aligned with those of the earlier
  investors, and if the later investors are, in fact, more sophisticated than the early investor, the early investor
   should welcome this.  But, if the early investor negotiated a more formal board seat early on, they'll find
   themselves at the table during these discussions, instead of playing catch up. </p>

<p>The second reason that board seats get more valuable is that when a company matures, the risk profile of an early
investment changes, and some management decisions can have a sizable impact on the realizable value of an investment.
 For example, a company that has taken early stage capital, grown organically, then taken on growth-stage capital
  and continued to expand may be in a position to begin looking for exit opportunities.  Here, the incentives of
   management may become imperfectly aligned with those of early stage investors.  Early investors are sitting on
   equity with a significant theoretical gain, but in the absence of distributions, they have no way to capture it.
   Management may be sitting on a gain, too, but they're also receiving salaries, so they may be in less of a hurry to
   capture their gain.  The growth-stage investor may have a smaller gain, but might have a longer time horizon to try
    to build value.  While its unlikely that an early investor will be able to cause the company to pursue a liquidity
    event, being in a position to formally discuss the options with management and larger shareholders (vis-a-vis a board
     seat) may put the early investor in a better position to influence  the discussions. </p>


<p><strong>Conclusion (<i>and an aside</i>)</strong> </p>

<p>This list is incomplete.  There are other important terms and conditions that an investor should negotiate for
 themselves when joining an early stage deal.  But, when I look back on investments I've seen or been a part of over
  the years, these items stand out as some of those "phew" or "shucks" things (as in, "phew, glad I negotiated that,"
  or "shucks, I wish I had negotiated for that") that can be the difference between a deal that works out well,
  and one that may not.   Losing money on a failed startup is painful, but feeling disadvantaged, or even suffering
  economic hardship on an investment that's actually successful because early terms weren't negotiated well is almost
   more painful.  A little extra protection early can help stave off these late stage pangs of investment regret.    </p>
