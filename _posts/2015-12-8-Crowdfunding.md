title: Crowdfunding, Private Markets, and What the New Rules are Missing
---
<p>A little over a month ago, the SEC approved their new crowdfunding rules<sup>1</sup>, which come several years after
 the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act first provided "an exemption from the registration requirements of Securities Act Section
  5 for certain crowdfunding transactions."  The goal with this was to give ordinary, non-super wealthy people, access to
  private investments.  And, as goals go, that sounds like a nice one. The idea that people can generally do what they want
   with their money is appealing. And of course, private markets get a lot of buzz these days, with companies like Uber and
    AirBnB raising huge sums of private capital thereby delaying a potential IPO<sup>2</sup>. And of course,
    there's <I>this</i>:</p>

<p>"“You are going to find more demand from Main Street businesses—restaurants, cafes and bars—marketing to their
existing customers. It will be an alternative to bank financing"<sup>3</sup></p>


<p>In other words, if you like the lattes from your local, independently owned coffee shop so much that you wish you'd
 be included in a general solicitation to invest in the business, you might get the chance! But, there's a catch. The
  SEC's bargain with private companies is basically this; they'll lift some restrictions on who can invest, and how
  those people can be solicited, but the investments have to be made through SEC registered broker-dealers or funding
  portals, and will be subject to some additional disclosure requirements.  </p>


<p>These new rules won't make these investments much safer for the general public, though, because while they require
some additional disclosures from companies using the crowdsourcing exemption, they don't impact the basic market structure
 issues that contribute to the difficulty and risk inherent in private investing. </p>



<p><strong><ins>There are 3 reasons investing in private securities is riskier than investing in
public securities.  </ins></strong></p>


<p>At the risk of oversimplifying, private markets and public markets have three distinct differences that makes private
market investing riskier than public market investing.  </p>


<p><strong> Liquidity & Pricing Transparency </strong></p>

<p>It is very easy to find out where publicly traded companies are trading at any particular time. Most investors probably
use electronic brokerages with websites that provide real time quotes, and in a pinch, you can always type the ticker symbol
into Google and get a recently traded price. By extension, investors can also trade these stocks whenever they want to.
 "Bids" are prices that people are willing to pay for a stock, and "offers" are prices at which people are willing to sell
 the stock. And in our public stock markets, there are almost always relatively competitive bids and offers for individual
 stocks.  So, an investor looking to sell a stock they own can usually find a willing buyer for a reasonable price. </p>


<p>Private markets don't work that way. For one thing, there's no one, big centralized exchange or network of exchanges on
which ownership interests trade, so there's no "bid-ask" readily available. If an investor who owns shares in a private company
 wants to sell those shares, he has to literally go <I>find someone</i> to buy them.  And, even if he's successful in doing
 that, there might be transfer restrictions on that stock. And even if there aren't transfer restrictions, what price will he
  sell the stock for? He'll have one idea of what the stock is worth, but the buyer will have another. Public markets act as
  a big price discovery mechanism; lots of buyers and lots of sellers place bids and offers in the marketplace, and a the best
   bids trade with the best offers. But the private seller and the buyer he found are just two people, so there's not much in
    the way of a market-based price discovery process to be had. </p>


<p>All this is really just a long way of saying that money invested into private companies is basically stuck in that company
 until it sells itself, goes public, or some large institution comes and buys up all the little investors on the cap table.
 Those things take a long, long time to happen, if they happen, and the investor has almost no control over them. Of course,
 pretty typical language in disclosure documents that accompany these investments is a paragraph that asks investors to certify
 that, basically, they don't need the money they're investing for anything else in the near or far term. So, if an investor were
 to actually read these disclosures, they'd be reminded of the illiquid nature of these investments. <sup>4</sup></p>


<p><strong>Disclosures</strong></p>

<p>Executives at companies trying to go public are required to make a number of disclosures, and once they're listed publically,
ongoing disclosures are required. For example, publicly traded companies are required to file annual reports (Form 10-K) that
disclose all sorts of information about the company's financial condition, business, new products, subsidiaries, etc.  They're
also required to file quarterly reports (Form 10-Q), which discuss the ongoing financial condition of the company.  And, just
 so nothing is left out, there's Form 8-K, which is basically a catch-all filling required anytime something happens that
  shareholders should know about.  The SEC wants public companies to disclose a number of different types of events on their
   8-Ks, like new material agreements, purchase or sale of assets, and also "other events," which is meant to capture events
    not specifically listed but that would otherwise be of interest to shareholders.</p>


<p>The SEC rules on Crowdfunding follow a similar, albeit somewhat watered-down, structure of disclosures. Companies relying
on the crowdfunding exemption would be required to disclose how they arrived at the price of the securities, for example.
 They'd also be required to submit financial statements for the preceding 12-month period, some information from relevant
 tax returns, a description of how they'll spend the money raised, and information about certain related party transactions.
  But, the ongoing reporting requirements set forth in Securities Act Section 4A(b)(4) require only an annual report, and say

  nothing about quarterly reports or reports on other material events. In the worst cases, that means that investors may hear
   from company management only once per year, and material events could transpire during the year of which the
   investors are simply unaware<sup>5</sup>. Regardless of management's motives, information that may have been relevant to the value
   of the investment would never reach the investors.  </p>


<p>Investors in private companies are therefor relying on 2 things to get ongoing material information about the business;
whatever specific information sharing obligations are listed in the stockholders agreement, and the good intentions and
ability of Management to be communicative. One of these things has to be explicitly negotiated and followed up on. The
other probably shouldn't be relied upon if one can help it. </p>



<p><strong>Pre-Investment Vetting Process</strong></p>


<p>Companies only become publicly traded after they've convinced a number of accountants, analysts, bankers, lawyers, and
regulators that their financials are legitimate and that their business is at least reasonably sound. This is what the
underwriting and road show process is all about- convincing large institutions that your company is good investment. So,
when an individual buys a publicly listed stock, he does so knowing that at the very least 1) some investment bankers and
buy side analysts thought it wasn't a horrible company at some point, and that 2) somewhat recently, an auditor has given
 their financials a once over and thought they at least didn't look fraudulent. Don't get me wrong- this is a very low bar,
 and in no way ensures that a particular public company is a good investment. But, it probably does mean they'll have at
 least a smaller chance of failing than companies which haven't navigated those hurdles. (Frankly, if it doesn't mean that
  then the system probably isn't functioning properly).  Of course, every now and then a "Pets.Com" sneaks its way past
  all those white-shoe sentries, lists it's stock to great fanfare, and flops under the weight of an ill-thought out business
  model.  And, sometimes companies do stupid things like engage in massive, fraudulent accounting schemes that elude everyone
  from Wall Street to Main Street(e.g., Enron).  But, these are the exception rather than the rule. Companies may decrease in
   value, but retail investors who lose money on them are probably in pretty good and educated company.  </p>


<p>The private markets operate with more opacity.  There are no "road shows" for early stage companies; their financials
are seldom audited, and even if they were, many are either pre-revenue or still operating at a loss; investment bankers
 steer clear because selling early stage interests is significant work and reaps meager fees.  Large situations typically
 pass on early equity rounds because they either don't have the risk appetite, or they can't invest enough money to make

 it worth the hassle of evaluating the business. The founders, who have the most information but also the most bias, are
 the ones principally tasked with selling the securities. So, the process is short on objectivity, long on informational
  asymmetry, and may feature a dearth of highly  experienced investors.</p>



<p><strong>Well, then….. </strong></p>


<p>My point is not that this will cause financial ruin to the public. Since the SEC capped the amount of money than an
individual making less than $100,000 per year can invest into these offerings at either $2,000 or 5% of their income or
net worth (whichever is smaller), it's doubtful that these investments will be ruinous to anyone.  And, I'm not even sure
 how frequently the crowdfunding exemption will be used<sup>6</sup>.  But, that's somewhat beside the point. Investing in
  any type of market carries risks to investors. And the SEC's job is to enforce rules that will protect investors.  Here,
   in the SEC's 300+ page rules, they've protected investors primarily by limiting the amount of money that can be put to
    work this way. The rest of the rules probably help somewhat, too, but they're an incomplete solution to the question of
    How to Make Private Investing Safer for Retail Investors. The market "safety" that's found in the public markets ultimately
    comes from a combination of rules and regulations, and a robust, codified infrastructure that mitigates some of the
    structural risks to investing. For crowdfunding to take off, and for investors in crowdfunded offerings to be protected,
     it needs well thought out regulations and the sort of established market structure that exist in the public markets.
      Congress and the SEC can do part of the work- time and market forces will have to do the rest.  </p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The rules (685 pages, but only about 300 of them are actually the "rules"). http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2015/33-9974.pdf . </p>



<p><sup>2</sup>I'm also not sure it's a great idea to start opening the venture capital doors to retail investors when
we're in what is most likely a valuation bubble for private companies.   </P>

<p><sup>4</sup>I strongly suspect that very few people read these documents carefully.</P>

<p><sup>5</sup>Investors may still be protected by various other statues, since failure to disclose material facts could potentially
constitute fraud, and could violate State securities laws depending on the circumstance.</P>

<p><sup>6</sup>It's ultimately going to be easier to raise money the "old fashioned" way, through exempt offerings only to accredited investors.  </P>
