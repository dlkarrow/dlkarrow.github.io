<p>The OECD published an interesting working paper on bitcoins earlier this summer.  It's
    available <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/5jz2pwjd9t20.pdf?expires=1408398222&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=3C0740D34767C6DFD28EC7C513A2988A" >here</a>.
    <em>(Bundell-Wignall, A. (2014), "The Bitcoin Question: Currency versus Trust-less Transfer Technology", OECD Working
        Papers on Finance, Insurance, and Private Pensions, No. 37, OECD Publishing.)</em> The paper makes some
    interesting observations about the policy issues facing crypto currencies, particularly those that arise as they
    begin to become a more conventional means of exchange.</p>

<p>Crypto currencies have had an inauspicious start toward their adoption as a widely used medium of exchange,
    their provenance being, in part, the currency of electronic black markets like Silk Road and other illegal
    activities.  The failure of Mt. Gox and allegations of fraud, theft, and mismanagement that led to the loss
    of $400 Million worth of bitcoins was another stain on the crypto currency's reputation.</p>

<p>Still, crypto currencies are catching on, and the OECD paper gives real thought to the issues facing
    the adoption of them as stores of value and mediums of exchange.  But, the paper also obliquely illustrates
    the paradox that the greater traction crypto currencies get, the greater the push to regulate them, and the
    less appeal they'll have to those currently propagating their rise. </p>

   <p>
    <em><strong>A quick aside:</strong>  This post deals with crypto currencies as innovations in economic means
    of exchange, rather than as innovations in technology, which they certainly are.  Dan Primack highlighted
    this in a piece several months ago available <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/02/06/why-venture-capitalists-are-right-to-be-crazy-about-bitcoin/" >here</a> and
    it's worth reading.  As Dan points out, the technology behind bitcoins might be even more valuable in
    applications beyond a replacement for money, and that the broad impact of this technology might dwarf
    its impact on currencies. </em></p>


<p>Crypto currencies have blossomed primarily due to three types of market actors; the curious spectator;
    the economically nefarious; and those avoiding government oversight or entanglements into their transactions.
    Some market participants fit into more than one of those categories.  </p>

<p>The curious spectators are keeping an eye on crypto currencies, but are mostly on the sidelines.
    Most Americans who are aware of crypto currencies probably fit this category.  A minority may have had
    a little first hand experience with crypto currencies.* These market participants find the idea of bitcoins
    interesting, but most have never transacted using them, nor do they have imminent plans to do so.  The
    curious spectators will watch the ebb and flow of crypto currency's popularity, but they may not have a horse
    in the race.  Of course, as these alternative forms of "money" gain traction, their interest may increase and
    their willingness to use them as forms of currency will, too.  Today, however, they're waiting for crypto
    currencies to present some discernable economic benefit over traditional means of exchange before they wade
    into the marketplace.</p>

<p>The economically nefarious are those for whom the "anonymity factor" is the principal appeal of the currency
    because if the illegal nature of their transactions.  Their economic activity takes place largely on the black
    market, and crypto currencies are the 21st century's "bag full of cash" for these illicit transactions.
    Its hard to know how numerous these transactions are, but it's generally accepted that a common use for bitcoins
    is to conduct illegal trade. <em>(http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/10/how-the-feds-took-down-the-dread-pirate-roberts/)</em>  It's
    worth noting, however, that unless all of one's economic activities can be conducted with bitcoins, most crypto
    currencies earned through the black market will eventually have to be turned into legal tender. <em>(Blundell-Wignall)</em></p>

<p>The third category includes anyone looking to avoid the scrupulous eye of the government, and for these participants,
    the "anonymity factor" may be important as well. This category could include the economically nefarious, but could
    also include people who have completely legitimate reasons for avoiding government actions or oversight.  An old
    Forbes article available <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/11/21/finally-a-proper-use-for-bitcoin-avoiding-capital-controls/" >here</a>
    illustrates how bitcoins could be used to avoid capital controls in countries like China.  It's more speculative,
    but crypto currencies could also be powering black markets in countries with oppressive regimes, where "black market"
    items might include religious artifacts or western newspapers, or facilitating the creation of anti-government propaganda.
    The ability to transact "anonymously" might be as important to democratic activists fighting tyrannical governments as
    it is to those engaged in less scrupulous conduct.  And, those who are ideologically opposed the federal monetary system,
    or elements of it, might find bitcoin to be a useful tool, consistent with their principles. </p>

<p>The  paradox, alluded to in the OECD working paper but not fully explored, is that the current users of bitcoins use
    them expressly <em>because</em> they are unregulated, anonymous, and not centrally created or controlled.  Various
    regulatory safeguards might help reduce fraud and price volatility, and help bring crypto currencies into the mainstream,
    but they would also undermine the very features of these currencies the current marketplace finds attractive. </p>

<p>What needs to be shown is that there is some benefit to ordinary consumers who don't fit into the categories above to
    adopting crypto currencies as an alternative means of exchange. Adoption by retailers isn't enough.  If Amazon begins
    accepting bitcoins for purchases, there still needs to be some compelling reason why using bitcoins is easier or cheaper
    for consumers than using ordinary US dollars with a credit or debit card.  Even if the savings that are accrued to Amazon
    by avoiding banks and credit card processors are passed onto consumers who pay with crypto currencies, those savings would
    be small, in the short term, relative to the potential headaches for the customer of adopting a new payment method.
    With some savvy marketing, people making large purchases might be properly incentivized to use bitcoins upon checkout
    (similar to being offered 10% during checkout in exchange for opening a store credit card), but such a strategy would
    still rely on a general acceptance and understanding, as well as a certain prevalence, of bitcoins, which doesn't yet exist. </p>

<p>Crypto currencies are in their infancy, and the technology underlying them is fascinating, and may have significant impacts
    on other technologies.  But, their widespread adoption as an alternative method of
    exchange is neither guaranteed, nor guaranteed to be fast. Innovations in payment systems have historically taken significant
    time, and many of the methods of exchange used today have been around for many years.  Metal coins were first used in 600 B.C.
    in modern day Turkey.  The first paper money was created in China in the 10th Century. In the 11th century, an Iranian traveler
    named Nasir-i Khosrau used a method of payment called a <em>sakk</em>, which is commonly considered to be the first "check."
    <em>(Quinn, S., and Roberds, W., The Evolution of the Check as a Means of Payment: A Historical Survey, Federal Reserve Bank of
        Atlanta Economic Review, No. 4., 2008). </em>  This does make the bitcoin's relatively rapid surge in popularity all the
    more interesting, but the ultimate success of crypto currencies as a means of exchange, store of value, or investment vehicle
    will depend on whether they offer some compelling alternative to other currencies and how quickly people adopt these new systems
    of payment. </p>
<p><em>*A few years ago, my partner Mike wanted to see the bitcoin process from start to finish, so he and our head of technology
    set up a little mining operation.  Bitcoins had been around for a while, but the concept was just starting to grab the general
    public's attention, and we wanted to see how a bitcoin went from crypto currency to tangible, United States currency.  Over the
    next several week and months, after cobbling together a rudimentary mining operation out of old trading servers, we successfully
    mined a bitcoin. But then, while we were discussing whose bank account would be provided to the bitcoin exchange for the purpose
    of the transfer (no one was eager to offer theirs up) Mt. Gox, the bitcoin exchange which held our bitcoin, ceased operations,
    and declared that over $400 Million worth of bitcoins had gone missing, of which ours was one.  As far as I know our bitcoin is
    sill among the lost.</em> </p>  -->
